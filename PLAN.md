# Mach4 CNC Plugin Development Plan

## Project Objective
Create custom user interface widgets for Mach4 CNC control software, specifically targeting the Avid Benchtop Pro CNC machine.

## Current Status: Research Phase

### Research Goals
1. **Understand Mach4 Plugin Architecture**
   - How plugins are structured and organized
   - Programming languages and frameworks used
   - Development tools and environment setup
   - Plugin installation and deployment process

2. **UI Widget Development**
   - How to create custom UI components in Mach4
   - Available UI frameworks and libraries
   - Integration with Mach4's existing interface
   - Event handling and data binding

3. **Avid Benchtop Pro Integration**
   - Specific requirements for Avid CNC machines
   - Hardware communication protocols
   - Machine-specific configurations and settings

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Testing and debugging approaches
   - Development environment setup
   - Documentation and examples

### Research Tasks
- [ ] Search for official Mach4 plugin development documentation
- [ ] Find community forums and developer resources
- [ ] Locate example plugins and source code
- [ ] Research Avid Benchtop Pro specific requirements
- [ ] Identify development tools and SDKs
- [ ] Find tutorials and getting started guides

### Research Sources to Investigate
- Mach4 official documentation and support sites
- CNC community forums and discussion boards
- GitHub repositories with Mach4 plugins
- YouTube tutorials and demonstrations
- Technical blogs and articles
- Avid CNC documentation and support resources

## Next Phases (Post-Research)

### Planning Phase
- Define specific UI widgets to develop
- Choose development approach and tools
- Create project structure and architecture
- Set up development environment

### Implementation Phase
- Develop core plugin framework
- Create individual UI widgets
- Implement Avid Benchtop Pro integration
- Build testing and validation tools

### Testing Phase
- Unit testing of components
- Integration testing with Mach4
- Hardware testing with Avid CNC
- User acceptance testing

## Success Criteria
- Successfully create and deploy custom UI widgets
- Seamless integration with Mach4 software
- Proper functionality with Avid Benchtop Pro CNC
- Clear documentation for future development

## Notes
- Mach4 plugin development appears to be underdocumented
- Research phase is critical for project success
- Python helpers will be used for supporting research activities
- Documentation should be thorough given the lack of existing resources
