Table Top Installation & Calibration
The instructions and images in this section show installation on the machine's crossmember extrusion. For mounting on a
spoil board, it is recommended to cut a pocket in the spoil board for the rotary frame to sit in. Use a pocket width of 3 5 5mm
(1 4") and depth of 5 mm (3/1 6"). Position the rotary frame flush against one edge of the pocket.
An assembly video is available as a complimentary guide during installation and calibration of your Avid CNC rotary axis:

## 1.4 Touch Plate Offset
This section will determine the offset from the touch plate to the center of the chuck for the Z axis and axis perpendicular to
the rotary frame. You will then be able to use the touch plate to set your rotary fixture offsets. This procedure will only need to
be completed during initial assembly and installation.
Caution
Before continuing, it is highly recommended to fully read section
## 1.4 Touch Plate Offset
to be familiar with the probing
routines used. Failure to follow the procedure can cause the machine to crash.
