## 1.1 Machine Preparation
The recessed (undermount) rotary mounting kit allows the rotary assembly to be installed between any two crossmembers
that are within the work area of your Avid PRO CNC Machine. The images used throughout the mounting process that
show the rotary assembly installed at the front of the machine are for illustrative purposes only.
The following steps to prepare your machine will ease in the installation and calibration of your rotary assembly.

## 1.4 Touch Plate Offset
This section will determine the offset from the touch plate to the center of the chuck for the Z axis and axis perpendicular to
the rotary frame. You will then be able to use the touch plate to set your rotary fixture offsets. This procedure will only need to
be completed during initial assembly and installation.
Caution
Before continuing, it is highly recommended to fully read section
## 1.4 Touch Plate Offset
to be familiar with the probing
routines used. Failure to follow the procedure can cause the machine to crash.
