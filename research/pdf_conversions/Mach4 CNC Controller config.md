Chapter 1 Introduction to CNC Systems
This chapter introduces you to terminology used in the rest of this manual and explains the purpose
of the different components in a computer numerically controlled (CNC) system. CNC machines are in
many industries and becoming more popular in manufacturing lines. The traditional machine types are
Mills, Routers, Lathes and Plasma cutters. The non traditional things that can be done with a CNC system
can be but not limited it laser measurement, pick and place, quilting, assembly, laser cutting, rapid
prototype, painting and so on. Because of the popularity of CNC's in non traditional CNC industries
Mach 4 has been made to be extremely configurable and expandable. The ability to add and remove
modules will be covered in this manual but the screen and scripting customization will be covered in
there respective manuals.
Before You Begin....
Any machine tool is potentially dangerous. Computer controlled machines are potentially more
dangerous than manual ones because, for example, a computer is quite prepared to rotate an 8"
unbalanced cast iron four-jaw chuck at 3 0 0 0 rpm, to plunge a panel-fielding router cutter deep into a
piece of oak, or to mill away the clamps holding your work to the table. Because we do not know the
details of your machine or local conditions we can accept no responsibility for the performance of any
machine or any damage or injury caused by its use. It is your responsibility to ensure that you
understand the implications of what you design and build and to comply with any legislation and codes
of practice applicable to your country or state. If you are in any doubt, be sure to seek guidance from a
professionally qualified expert rather than risk injury to yourself or to others.
Introduction
This document tells how to install and setup Mach 4 motion control software. The foundation of
Mach 4 is the core called Mach 4 Core, Mach 4 Core can be setup in many configurations for the following
machine configurations general automation, Mill, Router, Lathe, Plasma, Pick and Place, etc... A separate
documents explain how to operate Mach 4 with the specific machine types. The user interface has no
relation to the core or motion and/or IO devices used.

<!-- Page 5 -->

YOU WILL NEED TO READ THIS DOCUMENTATION! Mach 4 is a very complex software package that
cannot be simply made "to work" without proper configuration. The install and play with the settings
approach may work for other software packages but this is not the case with Mach 4. The time spent
reading the manual will save many hours of aggravation and will result in a better running machine. This
manual will give the steps in a logical order that must be followed.
Mach 4 Layout
Mach 4 is built on a central core called Mach 4 Core.dll and is what connects all the parts of Mach 4
together. The following diagram (see Drawing 1) shows how all the components are connected:
All IO, Motion and addon devices are plugins allowing them to be setup and configured in Mach 4. The
plugins supplied by Newfangled Solutions in the installer are added as appendixes to the end of this

document. Any plugins that are not being used should be removed from the system to lower the
overhead of Mach 4 on the computer. Development partners of Newfangled Solutions have access to
```
Mach 4's SDK allowing them to manufacture plugins for other devices and/or functions. The setup,
configuration, and any diagnostics will not be covered in this manual for their devices.
Chapter 2 Installing Mach 4 Software
If Mach 4's installer is not on the machine, a copy can be found at www.machsupport.com in the
downloads section of the web page. The machine tool does not need to be connected to the web to
install Mach 4.
If the machine is setup by an OEM or manufacture as a complete system, many if not all of the steps
in the following chapter may have already been done for you. The machine settings are all saved in the
profile directory with its own named directory. The named directories can be added and removed from
the profiles dialog but it is useful to know where the settings are. The named directory for each machine
contains all the machine settings in it's machine.ini file. The machine.ini file is backed up every time
mach 4 is started so the user can roll back settings if there was an error made during software
configuration. The other directories in the named profile directory contain the macros, tool table, fixture
table, ini backups, screw maps and so on. If a new computer is being setup to replace the an existing PC
with Mach 4 a simple copy of the profile named directory can be done to move over all the machine
settings.
Installation
Mach 4 is distributed by Newfangled Solutions over the internet. The software is available as a single
installer from the web-page with a download size of about 1 7 MB. After install Mach 4 will be in demo
mode with a limitation of how long Gcode will execute. The time the software can be run in demo is
about 2 0 min and then it will randomly stop in the middle of a run. Newfangled Solutions recommends
that Mach 4 is setup and tested before purchasing a license. Pricing and options are available at
www.machsupport.com .
Downloading
Download the installation package from www.machsupport.com . Click on the download link and
save the self-installing file on the desktop or in a convenient folder. Mach 4 needs to be install as
administrator, this can be done by right clicking on the self-installing file and telling it to âRun as
Administratorâ. If installing in a remote location the installation file can be saved and moved to a
6 Of 2 7


<!-- Page 7 -->

machine that has no web access. The file will require a CD or USB drive to have adequate storage
volume.
Installing
This section will guide the process of installing Mach 4 software. If Mach 4 has been previously
installed on the machine, Mach 4 can be installed on top of a previous installation. There is no need to
uninstall before reinstalling.
If a machine is connected:
The machine that is connected to the computer should be set in a condition that will not allow
motion or IO to be triggered. If the machine can be disconnected please disconnect. If the machine
can't be disconnected please press the E-stop button to put the machine into an E-stop condition.
Run the installer
Running the installer should be done as Administrator to allow Mach 4 to be installed correctly. The
package will be installed by default in the C:/Mach 4 directory. It is recommended that you keep the
installation directory as C:/Mach 4 so the support staff can better assist you with your future support
needs. The basic install will load the appropriate files needed for each machine type (Lathe. Mill and
Plasma).
Setting up the Profile
To test the installation double click on the Mach 4 Icon that was placed on the desktop by the Mach 4
installer. The icon will launch the Mach GUI.exe executable and allow the selection of a profile. It is
recommended that a new profile is setup for the machine that is being configured. A new profile can be
generated by pressing the "Create Profile" button (see Figure 1),but this will create a blank profile. If a
similar setup is available the "Copy Profile" button (see Figure 1) can be used to copy all the profile
settings and create the profile.

<!-- Page 8 -->

Figure 1
A "Copy Profile" is very powerful as it will copy all the machine settings such as the tool data, fixture
data, ini backups, Macros, and all machine settings. This can be used later to make a test profile to allow
changes to be made without harming the running machine profile. The profile can be removed after
testing is finished with the "Delete Profile" button. The profile settings can also be restored to a previous
session if a bad setting has been made. The "Restore Backup" button (see Figure 1) will launch the
Restore Backup dialog (see Figure 2). The machine.ini can be selected by looking at the Date and Time if
the last known running configuration.
Create Shortcut to Profile
8 Of 2 7
Figure 2


<!-- Page 9 -->

A shortcut can be created to allow the an immediate launch of the software with a selected profile.
By adding the following " /p Mach 4 Mill" to the end of the target string (see Figure 3) allows
Mach GUI.exe to load and immediately load the "Mach 4 Mill" profile.
Figure 3
Any other profile can be loaded by changing the profile name after the /p in the target string.
Chapter 3 Setting up the software
Step by step setting up of the machine
```
In this section the machine specific settings will be done to transform the software into a functioning
machine controller. The first step was to create a new profile to save the machine settings. This was done
as part of the installation process to protect the machine settings. If this was not done please review the
âSetting up the Profileâ section of this manual.
By the end of this chapter a typical machine should be setup and capable of motion and IO (inputs and
outputs). In order to setup the machine the first step is to install all the plugins that you need for the
machine. Examples of plugins that may be needed could be Parallel Port and Modbus.

Note: If the software is locked the configuration settings may not be available. If the software is locked
non of the configuration dialogs will be available.
```
Plugins and their function
The plugins in Mach 4 are the building blocks of the system. The plugins all use the Mach 4 core.dll as a
```
base but have the power to add functionality to the system. Plugins can perform the following functions
```
Scipting, Motion, IO, File conversions, File loading, Motion Generation and countless other functions.
```
The ability to add such functionality is fundamental in the setup of the machine. The most important
plugin is the motion control plugin. A careful selection of plugins needs to be done to add the
```
appropriate functionality for the machine to be configured.
Adding and removing Plugins
To add a plugin from a plugin archive file m 4 plugw for windows, m 4 plugl for linux, and m 4 plugm for
mac. To load a plugin archive navigate to the "Configure Plugin" Dialog (see Figure 5) by navigating
Configure/Plugins (see Figure 4)
Figure 4
```
A plugin must be enabled to allow the plugin to function. The software must be restarted after enabling
```
or disabling to allow the plugin function to change its state. To remove a plugin highlight the row of the
plugin and press the "Remove" button (see Figure 5).
Configuring Plugins
The configuration of the plugins can be done from the "Configure Plugins" dialog (see Figure 5). Not
all plugins can be configured as they have no settings that can be customized. For the plugins that can be
1 0 Of 2 7


<!-- Page 11 -->

configured a "configure" plugin button is available to the right of the pugin description. When the
configure button is pressed it will launch the configuration dialog supplied by the Plugin author. The
configuration of the device must be done before the devices IO can be accessed or used by Mach 4. The
configuration of the plugins incorporated in the installer will be covered in appendixes to this document.
Select Motion device
The first device that needs to be setup is the motion device. To select the device go to
"Configure/Select Motion Dev." (see Figure 4). The "Select Motion Device " dialog (see Figure 6) allows
the appropriate motion device to be selected. The selected motion device tells the core what device can
drive the motors and the high speed IO. The all other motion devices are set to be deactivated and will
not allow the IO or motion to be controlled. The system must be restarted after motion device has been
selected to allow the motion device plugin to do its startup initialization. After the restart the motion
device needs to be configured. To configure the motion device please use the Motion device supplied
manual and continue setting up the software once it is complete.

<!-- Page 12 -->

Other Plugins
The rest of the IO devices can be setup at this time if the settings are known. Some plugins that are
not fundamental to the machine can be setup at a later time. It is the responsibility of the installer to
determine what is needed to get the machine running. An example of a plugin that would need to be
setup and configured would be if a PLC was installed to enable the servo amps and machine. In this case
no testing can be done without Modbus communication to the PLC. To many machine configurations can
be done for this manual to take them into account so careful planning on the part of the installer is the
only way to get a system setup.
Chapter 4 Machine Settings
Default Modal State
The default state of the software is set at start-up or when the reset button is pressed. The following
options can be set and should only be set once. If the CV mode or some other setting needs to be
changed in a Gcode or for a short period of time, MDI should be used. The configuration dialogs are only
used for setting the start up state
All configuration settings can be found in the "Mach Configuration" dialog (see Figure 7). The following is
a description of the settings that can be changed in the dialog (see Table 1).

Motor Tuning
Motor tuning is one of the most important settings in configuring a machine. The settings available in
the motor tuning dialog (see Figure 8) will allow the motor to be setup for the appropriate Counts per
Unit, Max Velocity, Acceleration, Backlash, Direction Reversal and delay for enable signal. A detailed
description of each of the settings will be given in the following section.
1 4 Of 2 7 Figure 7


<!-- Page 15 -->

Counts Per Unit
The Counts Per Unit is used to convert the users units (Inches, Millimeters, Degrees,etc...) into
encoder counts or step pulses depending on the type of system. The counts per unit is a value that can
be found with mathematics. The value should never be âtunedâ or âadjustedâ because it is a
mathematical relationship with the drives, screw pitch, reduction ratio and so on. The following
examples will show how this value can be calculated:
Example 1: CNC Router with rack and pinion drive
Stepper Motor with 2 0 0 0 Steps per Rev
Belt Reduction (Small Pulley 1 5 teeth(Input Gear), Large Pulley is 4 0 teeth(Output Gear))
Pitch Ratio of the Pinion gear is .7 6 5 â
(Output Gear
Input Gear)âCount Per Rev
Pitch Dia=Countsper Inch
(1 5
4 0)â2 0 0 0
.7 6 5=6 9 7 1.6 7 7 5 6Counts Per Inch
Example 2: CNC Lathe with a lead screw
Lead of screw .2 5 inch Per Rev
Belt Reduction 1 5 tooth (Input Gear), 3 0 tooth (Output Gear)

Input Gear)âEncoder Countper Rev
Screw Pitch=Counts Per Inch
(1 5
3 0)â5 0 0 0
.2 5=4 0,0 0 0Counts Per Inch
As a rule of thumb an inch machine should have the steps per unit greater then 5 0 0 0 (2 0 0 for MM). A
value of 5 0 0 0 will give a resolution of .0 0 0 2 inches. A greater number of steps per unit will give better
performance as well as finer resolution. The only issue with a very high count per unit is that the max
velocity can become limited. The motion controller may only be able do deal with a limited number of
counts or steps per sec. Please check your motion controllers documentation to see get the max
frequency of the motors. If you would like to predict the max frequency this can also be done with
mathematics.
Max VelocityâCounts Per Unit
6 0=Output Frequency
In the next examples we will consider the max velocity to be 2 0 0 Inches per minute
4 0,0 0 0 counts per unit 2 0 0â4 0,0 0 0
6 0=1 3 3,3 3 3.3 3 3Hz=1 3 3.3 3 k Hz

6 0=2 3,2 3 8.9 3 Hz=3 2.2 4 k Hz
Velocity
The Velocity in the dialog is the maximum rate in units per min. This is also the velocity that will be
used for rapid moves when running Gcode.
Setting a Stepper:
On a stepper machine to set the max velocity a series of test need to be made. The Steps per Unit
must be set before the axis can be tested. Set a value of a max velocity that seems to be reasonable and
test with a jog at 1 0 0% jog rate. If the axis is able to move without missing steps (most times you will
hear a âbuzzingâ or âsquealingâ sound when steps are missed, repeat this process until the upper limit is
1 6 Of 2 7


<!-- Page 17 -->

found. Once the max velocity is found the max velocity should then be set to 2 0% - 3 0% less. To insure
that there are no missed steps during motion.
Setting a Servo:
To set the max velocity of a servo machine a small series of tests can be preformed or it can be done
mathematically with some calculations. When testing the max rate of a servo and the max velocity is
exceeded the servo may fault from being out of position (digital servo) or will not get to max velocity and
make an abrupt stop. If ether one of the following happen the velocity must be lowered until the
behavior is fixed. Once the motor is fixed the velocity should be lowered by 5% to insure that the best
performance can be obtained.
Acceleration
The max acceleration sets how quickly the motor can get to speed. The higher the acceleration the
faster the cutting can be done. The higher the acceleration the quicker an axis can reverse and go around
corners. Cycle times can be lowered by running higher accelerations and lowering the max velocity. The
acceleration should not be raised to the point that it causes motor stalling, vibration in the frame, or
other unwanted vibration.
Backlash
Backlash is used to take out mechanical wind up in the drive system. The misconception is that
backlash can be used to fix âslopâ in a screw/ ball-nut or slop in a rack and pinion. This can be used to
help fix the machine but is not the proper way to correct the problem. The only way to truly fix the issue
is to fix the mechanical issue. The backlash should never exceed .0 0 5 inches or .1 mm .
Reverse
The reverse section is used to reverse the motion of the motor.
Enable Delay
Enable delay will allow a the enable signals to turn on with a delay. The delay can be used to stage the
enabling of the amps. This can be used to lower the inrush current by enabling the amps one by one.
1 7 Of 2 7


<!-- Page 18 -->

Axis Mapping
The axis mapping dialog (see Figure 9) is used to set what motors are used for an axis as well as the
homing order and max limits for the axis. The motors can be assigned to an axis with a maximum of 6
motors per axis. The axis will use the lowest max velocity and the lowest acceleration. This is done to
alow slave motors to not have the same motor settings as the other motors associated to he axis. The
steps per unit also do not need to be the same for each motor that is part of the axis.
Homing and Limits
Setting the homing and limits will set what the machine will do when the machine enters a home
state or reaches a limit. The act of homing is fundamental in the operation of CNC's and automated
equipment. Homing the machine will set the machine zero position of the motors. This will be the base
from with all work / fixture offsets are calculated from. All the settings for the homing of the axis are
done in the Homing and Limits dialog (see Figure 1 0).
Home Direction
This sets the direction to home the axis (see Figure 1 0). Pos for homing in the positive direction Neg
for homing in the negative direction.
1 8 Of 2 7 Figure 9


<!-- Page 19 -->

Home Order
The sequence the axis home in can be controlled by setting the âHome Orderâ (see Figure 1 0). The
first axis to home will be axis with the number 0 and then subsequent axis will home with the next
greatest home order value. For example if you would like to home the Z axis first then the X and Y at the
same time the values would be as follows:
X=2
Y=2
Z=1
Home Offset
The home offset allows for a shift from the home switch position(see Figure 1 0). This can be used to
to shift the home position if the home switch is not located at the end of travel.
Home Speed
The home speed is the rate the machine moves to detect the home switch (see Figure 1 0). The home
switch will set the machine zero position with the addition of any home offset. The Home Speed is set as
a percentage of the max velocity of the axis. Example :
1 9 Of 2 7 Figure 1 0


<!-- Page 20 -->

Max Vel = 2 0 0 Units Per Min
Home Speed = 2 0%
Max Velâ(Home Speed
1 0 0)=4 0 Units Per Min
2 0 0â(2 0
1 0 0)=4 0 Units Per Min
Home In Place
The Home in Place selection tells the axis to set the machine zero where it is when a home axis is
requested (see Figure 1 0). This feature is used on machines that have no home switches or an axis that
has no home switch. On a machine with no home switches the axis can be moved to the end of the
travel and lined up with an indicator mark. With the machine at the home position the home can be
triggered for that axis setting the machine position. This will allow the softlimits to be used and fixture
offsets.
Soft Enable
The state of the Soft Enable tells the core if the axis should be checked against the upper and lower
soft limits (see Figure 1 0). With the soft limits active the axis will decelerate to the Max or Min limit if it
is jogging and will prevent any incremental jogs past the limits. When running Gcode any moves panned
past the limits will not be done and the machine will be put into a stop condition and a soft limit error
will be displayed.
Soft Max / Soft Min
The max and min settings are the most positive and negative machine positions for the axis (see
Figure 1 0). The most simplistic way to get to get the values is to use the machine position DRO's. The
process is to home the machine, jog each axis to the most positive position in each axis and enter as the
positive soft limit. Then repeat the process in the negative direction and set the min soft limit.
Signals in General
The signals are used to represent the internal state of items needed by the controller or items needed
```
to trigger IO for special functions. The signals can be triggered by Inputs, Outputs, Plugins, or Lua. When
a signal changes state, a state change event is propagated throughout the system and will be seen by all
plugins, and Lua event scripts. Later in the customization of Mach 4 the utilization of Mach 4's signals will
2 0 Of 2 7


<!-- Page 21 -->

be seen. In the section the setup of triggering IO with signals will be shown. When setting up an IO point
the device's plugin must be first setup. A device could be a motion controller, bussed IO (modbus), Input
device (keyboard), Special Functions in plugins, etc.. The âDeviceâ is the first selection and displays all
the registered IO devices to the system (see Figure 1 1)
Once the device is selected the appropriate Inputs / Outputs will be displayed in the I/O Name's
column. A drop down list will appear allowing the selection of the desired IO (see Figure 1 2). With the
Device and IO name selected the signal will now be tied to that IO. The Input signal will change state
when the Input assigned to it changes state, and Outputs are triggered by their associated Output
signals. The high / low state can be inverted by selecting the Active low state.

<!-- Page 23 -->

Input Signals
The input signals are used to connect Inputs from devices to Input Signals in the core. Some of the
most important signals are the Homing and Limit inputs. The Homing and Limits are set per motor NOT
per axis. The axis use motors to show what motors drive the axis and to display the state of the limits
and homes. As an example if Motor 1 and Motor 5 where used on the X axis and the + Limit was hit the X
axis would show positive limit as being active. The inputs of the motors are or'ed to the axis states.
Below is a complete list of the Input signals (See Table 2).
Input Signal Description
Input #0 To
```
Input #6 3 User inputs that can be mapped to any function
Motor 0 Home To
Motor 3 1 Home The home input of the motor with the associated number
Motor 0 ++ To
Motor 3 1 ++ Positive limit for the motor
Motor 0 â To
Motor 3 1 -- Negative limit for the motor
Digitize Probe input for G 3 1 commands
Index Once per rev input for getting the RPM of the spindle
Limit Override Override the limits to allow jogging when on a limit switch
E-Stop Used to tell the core that the system is in E-stop. This input is NOT to issue an
an E-stop but to tell that the one has occurred with the proper e-stop hardware
(Master control relay disabled for example).
THC On THC (Torch Height Control) is enabled allowing the head to be jogged up and
down while Gcode motion is active to keep a proper gap from the plate to the
tip.
THC Up Move the Torch tip Up when THC is active , Disabled it THC On is off
THC Down Move the Torch tip Down when THC is active, Disabled it THC On is off
Timing More then one input per rev to get spindle speed (legacy input and may not be
in all motion devices).
Jog Axis +/- Jog X+, Jog X-,Jog Y+... Command axis to jog in the +/- direction
Spindle At Speed Input to tell the the spindle is at the commanded Speed. This will take the place

Output Signals
The output signals are used to tie the device outputs to the output signals. The output signals can be
used to drive outputs directly for things such as Spindle ouputs, Coolant, indicator lights on panels and
so on.

Table 3: Output Settings
Spindle
The Spindle dialog allows the configuration and setup of up to 2 0 spindle rages. The spindle ranges can
be gears and or belt settings to allow for a change in the range of speeds avalable.
Output Signal Description
Min RPM The minimum RPM the spindle in the selected range
Max RPM The maximum RPM the spindle in the selected range
Accel Time The time to accerate the spindle in the slected range. If the âSpindle At Speedâ
signal is enabled the Accel Time is not need and should be set to zero. Any
value in the Accel Time field will be done after the Spindle At Speed signal has
been toggled.
Decel Time The time to decelerate the spindle in the slected range. If the âSpindle At Zeroâ
signal is enabled the Decel Time is not need and should be set to zero. Any
value in the Decel Time field will be done after the Spindle At Zero signal has
been toggled.
Feedback Ratio By default the Feedback ratio is 1, a value of one is used in an application
where the feed back device is mounted on the spindle. If the feedback device is
mounted on the motor or some other part of th gear train the feedback ratio
can be used to get the correct speed.
Reversed Reversed selection allows the spindle motor to reverse the direction based on
the reversed check box. This selection is used when a gear or ratio causes a
reverse in the spindle direction. It is common for knee type mills to reverse
direction from high to low range.
Max Motor RPM
The maximum RPM of the spindle motor. The reason for the maximum RPM is to allow for proper
scalling of the motors RPM on all ranges. The motor RPM is used by motion devices, plugins, VFD's, Lua
etc for planning the proper motor RPM to get the requested spindle RPM.
Motor as Spindle
With this selection a stepper motor, servo motor, or VFD that can be setup as a motor in the motion
device. The motor will be treated as an out of band axis and will use the motors acceleration settings.

Tool Path Settings
The toolpath has some parameters that can be changed to allow better visualation of the toolpath.
The colors of the toolpath can be changed to allow for a better âlookingâ toolpath. But more importantly
is the ablilty to change the color of the toolpath to aid color blind users.
Machine Limits
The machine limits can be show in the toolpath, showing where the machine can traverse to by
displaying dotted lines.
Extended Functionality
```
To get more extended functionality and or customization, Plugins and or scripts will need to be added
and configured. The Customization and scripting manual covers topics such as on screen buttons to
trigger outputs, Tool changers, Buttons to move the machine to a specific location, hardware buttons for
operator interfaces, etc. Some of the plugins are covered in the appendixes for your convenience . If the
plugin of interest is not covered in the appendix please visit www.machsupport.com and look under
Mach 4 plugins for more information.
