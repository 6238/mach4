hi welcome to another mac 4 quickie this is all about the keyboard plugin and how to automatically enable and disable it throughout the mac 4 screen when you need to if you notice down in the taskbar at the

moment my keyboard plugin is enabled but if i go and click on the mdi panel then it's now disabled and coming back out of the mdi panel again obviously it's going to enable itself if i load a piece of g-code

we'll have the good old roadrunner and then we go to edit it obviously we want to disable that keyboard as well well it does it's a simple bit of code running in the background there if we go to the edit screen

and i'm not using the pmc if we first look in the edit g code yes we've got a left up action there but we can still use the left up script action left up script action that's a different one anyway this is the script

let's find the handle of the keyboard enable and if that handle is there let's set the state to zero and zero is obviously disabled now with tabs you'll see you've got a on enter script and then on exit script well that's

exactly what it says when you enter the tab we're going to use that same code and disable the plugin and when we exit that tab we're going to enable it again i'll post the scripts in the form as well so you can just do a

bob basic lazy copy and paste if you like but well that's it that's another quickie finished i'll see you in the next one
