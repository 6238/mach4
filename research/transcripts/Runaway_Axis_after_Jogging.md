Strange runaway happening in Mach4

## Transcript

Hi. Something I come across recently which I thought I'd just share with everybody.

I've been designing me own screen which is in the color format of how I like it and I can see the screen.

The problem I came up with is doing the jogging buttons.

Clicking on them. I found one of me carriages would just run away. You know, I checked all my code. I'd done absolutely everything. Spent a long time trying to figure out why it was doing this.

So, I thought what I'd do is I'd load Mac 4 up with the ordinary Mac 4 mil, how it comes out the box or downloaded, how whatever, and see if we got the same problem in this one. Now, this is Mac 4 with the SIM running. If

you enable it, go to your jogging and set it to incremental.

Click on an axis and off we go. So, we got another runaway, which is pretty much dangerous really if you're sat beside your machine or you're not near your machine and it just you think you've only told it to jog

1 millm like mine was set and off it went. But don't get me wrong, this does not happen every time you start up Mac 4.

I don't know why. I don't know what causes it.

If you see in this run of it, you can enable your axis just like last time. Go to jog and it'll it'll basically do what you asked it to do in the first place.

So, let's shut down Mac 4 and just start it up again.

And once again, let's go to our jogging panel and set it to jog increments. and start jogging. And once again, you see it's just not doing it. So, we'll start again.

Go to our jog increments. And there we are. We we've got to run away once again.

But after a while, I did play about with this for quite some time.

If you go to your edit screen and then go to your screen load script, right at the bottom of the screen load, if you put in MCMC control enable instance and put it to a zero for off, I then run this on both my set setup

with the ESS and the SIM and I started closed it down started closed it down started closed it down just continuous I never got that access to run away whilst doing the jog panel after that it it was fixed as far as I'm concerned

well that's it for this video and unfortunately for all you lot there'll be loads more videos to come because I've gone through my peak period and from now till just after Christmas. I've got plenty of time on my hands. So, I'll

see you very shortly for another video.
