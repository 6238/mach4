Installing ModelWorks Simulator for Mach4

---

## Transcript

hi welcome to another Mac 4 video in this video I'm going to talk about the model works plug-in 3d kind simulator now in this video I will show you how I have installed it on my machine this doesn't mean it's how you've got to

install it on your version of Windows Windows 8 or Windows 10 I'm using Windows 7 pro and this is physically how I got it up and running and started using it on my own machine so the first thing we need to do is download the 3ds

simulation plug-in with this bum but something you need to understand is there is no demo of the 3d simulator plugging a lot of the foreign questions for model works might be because there is no demo to actually use this you have

to purchase a license without the license you won't see it working you will have a green box so once you have downloaded the plug-in and you've purchased a license for it we can go ahead and install the plug-in install it

whilst Mac 4 is not running and put it in the directory that your Mac for hobbies in click install and that's it that's that run part done now we're going to load up I've cooked that twice what's the matter with me today we're

not gonna bother with the model works one I'm going to delete that so I can show you how to add it to um private files I'm going to go from Mac four mill profiler so if you look in the bottom it says failed to license feature M for solid

sim and double using blah blah basically it can't find a license file so the way we license it in fact I'm going to show you what I'm not going to license it myself yet I'm going to go into the screen editor and in the tree I'm going

to select our main tabs and add another tab to it and call this simulator like so and in this simulator I'm going to add you probably all wonder what these but this buns for which is a plug-in panel now a plug-in panel is a way for

plugging or something to be released for the Mac for GUI like this simulator that's written in C++ so it's an easier way of just putting it out without everything the light and you do a code for as well so in this tab we'll add one

of these panels and I will resize it something like that and that's probably what you're used to seeing is that green screen now in the registers this is what you can put in that panel obviously you don't want to put a decoder

you would have my fingers one for the sim sim panel these a little demo panels to show you how they work but it should be the model works one in there but it won't show you because it's not licensed yet so let's go ahead and license it now

so you probably seen that screen before if you go into your help menu and go to a bell now this is where you would have originally licensed Matt for but we're going to do exactly the same it's not just for Mack forwards for any licenses

that you're gonna load into Mac for comes into here so we load the license file which is our 3d cutting simulator that's now installed but is what you'll have to do to initialize that is close Mac falldown start it back up again

finally all right so I'll simulate a panel still green because we haven't told that panel yet what to do so remember they're nearing the registers is our panel here this is the MW sims 0 panel you click on that and

then come out of your screen editor you'll find our simulator is now initialized the licenses in there and the panel's been made correctly what we do with it now
