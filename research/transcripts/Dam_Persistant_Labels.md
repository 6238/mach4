[Music] hi welcome to another Mac for quickie so when is a lure error not actually a lure error when have you been told you've activated limits which in you Hammond or for some apparent reason and he stops

being cleared well recently I have been seen a lure error while running junk for a long time whilst building a screen set I backtracked on this screen set after backing it up and I started deleting things and I got all the way down to

this history box was the only thing on my screen when I opened up Mac for it told me I've got a lower error now it puzzled me I'd never come across this before absolutely basically blank screen but I got a little error so I thought well

perhaps I've got something up somewhere so I backed off me Mac for folder first delete it reinstalled Mac for and stayed adding all the stuff again now a little bit further down the line I got a lower error again and it constantly stayed

there and normally when you get one of these lower errors that are on a couple of lines it does shrink the text but we're in history it doesn't show that there's anything there so you know even more confusing so what does this I mean

I've had it with yep it tells me I've hit a limit switch and I think well I've been nowhere near it or I've cleared an e-stop at one time now the reason why Mac 4 does this and this is just a little quickie so you don't fall for the

same thing that I did now whatever is in a label whether it be history profile you screen any other label that you've got on your screen once you go into your screen editor whatever is written within your label is the label here and then of

course you'll come out of I need to change at least one thing let's just stick you at seven four three once you come out of the screen set and it wants to save you have now saved that in your screen set so the next time you open up

Mac four it will show that because you've put it in your screen set it's not a bug it's it's working correctly because you might be using your label for absolutely anything and you don't want the text to change so you know you

just type it in but the only way to get rid of that it does doesn't show up in the history is to go into your screen editor and delete it so the next time you save your screen set it saves it as an empty box now this will only happen

whilst you edit in the screen it will save what is in there but normal running it you know it won't do it so next time I start Mac for now it won't show me a lower error in there one thing I've put on my screen is a

little button which all the labels that I don't want persistent it clears them all before I actually go into the screen editor so whenever I go in there all my labels are blank and that's it so I know it's a

um not a very interesting topic but like I say I just wanted to share that with you and I'll see you again very soon
