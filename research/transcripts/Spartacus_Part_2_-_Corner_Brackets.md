## Transcript

[Music] hi how familiar was that scene sitting about with your scraps of paper and coffee and just thinking about you what ifs and your butts and the house and where do I start next well I finally got the same bein laid out exactly how I

wanted it so now it was time to design the corner brackets but I couldn't just use my head and scraps of paper this there's a bit of software like CAD programs etc that we need to use so to start off this video I'm just gonna show

you how how I've got mine all set up so if you want to follow on and design and use the stuff that I'm using you're know exactly what I'm using and where I got them from so let's take a look first of all I'm gonna create a folder on the

desktop every think I put in this folder will be uploaded so whatever you see me put in there you can download and play with yourself now the CAD software I'll be using is gonna be SolidWorks there's a few reasons for it I come from a

background I've used a Libra design a lot and in fact I still use it for some 3d stuff but it's cut-down version called QB Phi I use that for a lot of me 3d stuff because you know it's really good I mean although I'm moving across

to SolidWorks on the 3d stuff it to me SolidWorks on Cuba fire pretty similar another big problem I had is I can't get on with Sketchup I just can't get up with it there's there's so many so much stuff on there

for sketchup say like mark spawn and a lot of other builds and in sketchup i just can't get out especially that little tape measure thing so anyway I'll be using SolidWorks now one of the more important things you need to do is go to

the open builds website join the open building Stav a look at some of the stuff that is on a that's been being built and this has all been built by open build stuff originally there might be some customized parts in there but it

all originates from what you can see in here well my first poor call is to go to the resources and have a look at some other stuff you can download now I'm going to be used in this library here the SolidWorks 2014 library I know I'm

not gonna include that in fact yes I will I'll upload it if I get any problems from Rob then I consume delete it but rubbers done fantastic job with the libraries if you use in SolidWorks but he's got a just version step

versions if you using Sketchup then you'll find the hole open builds parts there you go as a sketchup library there which is all the parts that's actually posted by mark that one so it's exactly dimensions and everything that is going

on so you can use Sketchup you can use SolidWorks loads of other programs and download and you can test your ideas on the screen before you go ahead and do anything so one of the first things I need to do is decide what wills I'm

gonna have on my Y carriage and they're going to be small one at the top or small one at the bomb I could use both of the center rails you know have them all many be wills I could double them up I could use big

wheels now I had problems there deciding which ones I was gonna have the reason why I needed to know these before I made the brackets is now if you remember on the ox with a big wheel at the balm you couldn't use a piece of 20 before he

laid on its side because the will was too big so then that would restrict us or restrict me from having a big wheel on the balm it means I would have to have a piece of 20 before he stood up exactly the same as what is on the Ox at

the moment so after downloading the parts library for the open built stuff I decided to have a little play putting bits together so started off with a 40 be $22 and then I added a corner block Knight to do is call in a block to one

side of the sea beam and 90 degrees plate on the other side and of course we actually have a sea beam end plate this gave me a general idea of what I was looking for so this is what I come up with 20 before he laid on its side 10

mill substrate and a corner blocks hold it down we had in the Seabee men play and removed the holes for this stepper take off the end that we don't need had a plate at the balm and cover up the corner block originally it's in 12 mil

so we'll cut it down to 6 mil and then the corners off nicely and this is the final product this is what the front plates are going to look like but let's have a look how did we put something like this together where

do we get the measurements from so let's create our first end plate so I'm going to go and open this is in the parts library for mob that I downloaded we go into the plate section see beam and mount we can now get all the dimensions

we need from this one plate everything's there that we need so we just need to transfer these measurements across to our own sketch so let's go make a new part don't like double-click that a sketch on our front plane and create our

block which is 50 millimeters wide by 80 millimeters high and we've got one two three for there and obviously our bear in health no dimensions dimensions radiuses of these 5.2 I think from them but lately

5.2 so we can go and change all these two I went to divided by two which is 2.6 it's probably an easier way of doing this but so how I've always done it so probably gonna stay that way and these want to be 10mil

Center and they're also 10 mil from the edge the distance between here is standard which is 20 this is going on CB measurements and that's also 20 and the distance between they and there is also 20 so this up I was all in the right places

for our CBD now we need the bear in what dimensions have we got for the bear in we've got thirty two point four in and eleven point one eight in radius so let's make that but 2.4 and the radius locked thank you

my radius is did I say 11 point one eight I think 11 point one eight by to give just five point five nine now I don't want a 50 mil plate so it's bigger than the actual C beam itself so I'm gonna cut this down so 40 mil which is

the same as the C beam and you'll now notice how close that bearing plate with a bearing here that is just for that sum for the actual acne rod to come through so by time the bearing is on top of that it's it's gonna be even bigger so I'm

gonna take this I'm probably bring this out so about 12.5 which brings out then we best trim a few bits off for now now you know why when looking through the open builds and other people's bills why that age is roughly the same there is

not really much more you can do with it now the plate at the bomb I'm gonna add that remember it's gonna anchor that down before forget how was it moves everything and the plate we're gonna write here was 20 mil hi

and because we've got an 80 plate already in a twenty that's hundred now I'm gonna make the wit for this exactly the same which is going to be a hundred and now we can trim off the bit we don't need which is there so our plate is now

taking shape now we're going to be using eccentric Sania so again let's add some eccentrics we're gonna have and again same size is less they want to be two point six and we're gonna make them ten mil from

the edge good guest seems that one is and the same with that one just ten mil and what do we got left there well from there to there we've got eighty eighty so if I went across about probably a little bit too much we'll drop that down

to 25 one ounce 25 which then leaves some bacon in the middle twenty seven point five that's gonna do it that's better just even zoom out a little bit and then of course we need to be 10mil from the edge so it makes it in the center of

them okay oops about our men shion's dementia us one looking for make that ten which what move should make that one about right yeah somehow that's then bulldoze all sent it up now remember I've got a block

going in here but first of all I've got my substrate change that Sergio much we make sure that sound good and then my substrate is only was it ten mil that's going on the top there and then the edge of one of them corner blocks is

20 so 20 and at 10 makes 30 so we need our corner block coming down here a 45 degree angle minus 45 should of course he's got it long way tie like in 45 degrees instead there we go it's down there and once again

trim off the excess let's exit sketch now look in pretty much like what we want yep go back in there now and let's round off a few of these corners you don't that much about two millimeter be fine they'll probably round it herself

off anyway then also we put it in just in case smoothing them corners off your weapon now what the hell know it now since I calling us all round it off feet much how it wants to be so let's exit the sketch go cross and we'll extrude that

would do if I chose something it's like a plane this one Daphne me that one then let's load that and I'm gonna be using six mill plate on the end starting to it like a part now yep right then so what do we need on top

of that well let's recess all of these bowls so let's go create another sketch and drop another cycle over each one of these and what size of these that we need that's gonna come across on something else which is to them they are nine

point two so let's swap all these over to nine point to ride that bike to sis radius ready four point six six what if I could do control sight and then change them all at the same time that's the same for four point six let's come out

of the sketch it's our features and then withing like screws head screwed extrude cuts all them now the normal measurement is one point five but I'm actually gonna go down one point six if there's any deviation at all in the m5 bolts tied

yeah then it was still cover click ok and there we go nice X screwed it there extrude excluded I've got it right now we need to put the bearing in there which is the other side let's create another sketch and circle and the size

of that is 16.1 that's gonna be 16 point 1/2 exit sketch and it's a 5 mil bearing way I'm sure whether I want to do it five milks and he leaves me one mil the other side to hold the bear in I'm actually gonna

take that down four mil in fact no 44.5 yeah four point five I'm gonna take that down and there we have the first front plate complete so we need to do is save this file and then we can create an image of this file and we have both of

our front plates complete now for the rear plates we're gonna need to put the holes back in to mount the stepper motor on but I'm going to use four brackets so here's a quick and easy way of doing that so first of all let's create a new

part go into the sketch I'm going to put a couple of lines in and change them to geometry lines don't cut them down if we have if we take a look at stepper motor you'll see you've got all the information that we need

there which is gonna be full so like fifty-seven max there and we've got the dimensions between the holes so if we go back to our part we're gonna need for four holes for the steppers and they're gonna be forty seven point fourteen from

there to there is seven point one four divided by two this gives us twenty three point five seven and we need that between every every power of it seven you gotta be an easier way and that's stem the whole space till now the holes

there normally if you're gonna thread them in using m5 you really want to be doing them I think it's about four mil I think 90% but I'm gonna have the bolts go in full mine so mine are gonna be well my holes are gonna be for m5 which

will be 2.6 change them and then we want to put a box around the outside starting to look like a stepper motor now and we'll make them or a stepper motor is 56 it says 57 max so we're gonna make it 58 well I'm gonna make it 58 right I can

go along delete these lines now now if I select everything go to edit copy go back to our plate that we had go into the sketch and then do paste and I'll bring this up there which obviously you can see is in the wrong place

straight away move entity and entities and we'll move the center point over our bear in hole zoom in and then we can start trimming off what we don't want yeah nicely hold of it and that's it that's their more gun to

mail just redo our corners there we are exit the sketch we've now got a bearing plate now because I'm doing mine different on here instead of the bolts being threaded in I'm actually sinking my bolts in from the other side so I've

got to create a new sketch on here and add purely for the stepper I'm no recesses for the poets and the size of them were was it 9.2 I can't quite remember now look yeah let's exhale there for a second

I got some on this site 9.2 was it these were nine point two divided by four point six six six okay do I not get are we one point six keeping with the others reassessed on the back and that's it that's the I can

just mirror that now and well that's all four corners complete so I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna print all the B's out now I'm gonna save all the files so I've got a right bearing left bear in right step a plate left step up late and

I'm also gonna save mouth as STL files and run them through the 3d printer so see you in a minute when they're printed well that's everything print it with the addition of a seat beam mini will play I've checked all the bearings and have

you thinking you have a place they all seem fine and I've assembled one of the stepper motor place so let's get in the mom machine and have a look well that's the brackets all fade they fit absolutely perfect lineup bearings

fit in I've put some acne blood in and the mini mini will plate to give it a good ol D won't test let's have a go [Applause] well as you can see everything runs really nice and smooth I'm happy with a call in a box now the idea originally

for doing them in 3d print in plastic was if I change my mind then I haven't wasted any aluminium but anybody that knows me to hear me say I'm happy with them they know it you know I'm happy with them because I'm always

changing my mind but I'm not confident with these and happy with them I think we're gonna cut these out of aluminium and get them set on the machine they're not gonna change but that's not gonna be in this video I'll see you soon

so there we are then that's the front black but black front black it's not all that much went wrong in making this video but I thought I'd just show you how will he corner pockets tonight we're just gonna burn these now
