## Transcript

[Music] Well, how many of you remember using this screen? This is version 2270 of Mac 4 which was round about March 2015. And this is the more current up to-ate version of Mac 4. And again this is the Mac 4 mil

profile. But it's not just cosmetic.

It's not just what you can see on the screen has changed. There's so much changed in the core. Now, looking back in my earlier videos, I think I was just a little bit biased of what videos I made. I only

made videos on stuff that I was using, which like I said, I think was a little bit biased.

This time round, we'll have a more indepth look at the guey editor, we'll edit our screens. We'll go through all the commands and objects, in fact, they're called that we have here that you can use in the Mac 4 editor.

But we'll also use some objects that aren't actually there. They're not shown on there, but we're using WX widgets like WX Lure. So, there are absolute hundreds more that you can actually use within your

guey. Well, Mac 4 has got some new features and obviously some existing features that I've never covered. I mean, one of the new features is this PMC editor. Now, this is a ladder logic um generator, lure script generator if you

like. If you're not wanting to get into programming and you don't want to write your own scripts, this ladder logic will help you create some of the scripts that you will probably need. Might might save

you from pulling some of your hair out.

I'm old school. I don't use it, but I might as well learn how to use it. Same as some of the plugins. We go into the plugins. We've got keyboard plugin. We got Modbus, Reds, File, Shadow Pro. Now, I don't use any of them. So, I will use

them. I will make a few videos because obviously there's a lot of other people out there that do use them. Moving on. We're also going to take a look at these wizards. Not for the wizard theirel of how to run these wizards, but we're

going to make our own wizards. We'll go in depth and we'll use some external programs. One of them which is absolutely great for making your own wizards within Mac 4 is WX Form Builder.

Now obviously when we get to this part all the download links for it will be there but you might want to just download WX form builder and take a look. You can create your own guey within form builder and then you can add

your code in afterwards. This is what makes up your wizards. But any one of them wizards you make, you can actually embed that into your Mac 4 screen using the panel within the gooey guey editor. In other stuff that you

might be interested in, I know I use it a lot is a Notepad++ plug-in which has been written by Brett and well for me it's absolutely fantastic. This this is my screen. This This is how I write everything for my

screen. Like I say, I don't use the gooey editor, but things like this little plugin will make things so much easier for you. Well, that's about it for this video.

Um, hopefully it's given you an insight into what's coming in the future with my videos and why a lot of my older videos are being deleted.

If there's anything that you might like to see on a video within the series, then please just drop a PM on the Mac forum or obviously on the YouTube channel. I have come to realize in the last few weeks it's so much easier for

me to do a twominute video on how to do something than it is to sit there for an hour a time trying to write something out on the forum trying to explain.

So I will see you in part one which will be all about downloading Mac 4 and setting up the environment for your machine and obviously just a quick run through of where everything is.

[Music] Heat. Heat.
