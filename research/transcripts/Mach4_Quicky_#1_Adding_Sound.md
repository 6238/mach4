## Transcript

hi welcome to the first of many tutorials on programming Mac 4 I'm going to make the first one here quite simple going to add some sound to Mac 4 it's too quiet for me so if we go to the screen editor we go into our Mac 4 screen load

script scroll down the button to load sound into Mac St straightforward WX command called WX sound so what we're going to do here we're going to assign a variable called Ding in fact I'm not going to call it ding because I'm not

using ding I'm going to call it log off because that's the sound I'm using just as a test it starts off with log off variable equals wxwx sound then we give it the name of the file we want want it to play with a comma the last zero purely

means false and that's what it's asking for is it a re resour resource or is it a file it's always going to be zero for a false so we'll quit out of that script save it I'm going to go and put a nice button on well we we'll put it there so

I can find it easy that button just for the fun of it it's not going to stop here I'll call it log off in this script to run it this is going to be so straightforward it's log off and then we'll tell it to

play pla what's a plat let's call it play instead we'll save that put out of it again put out the edit screen so it saves everything that's it done don't know what me log off where me log off went for that button but it's

called button again now and each time you click it obviously that will play the sound but it can be done for many more than that in my own personal screen I've got different sounds for if it hits any of the end stops just different bits and

pieces for that if it comes to the end of a G-Code and it it'll I just got warning signs I know what they are anyway that's it for this Mac 4 quickie and I'll see you for next quickie that don't sound quite like that does it see

you next time
