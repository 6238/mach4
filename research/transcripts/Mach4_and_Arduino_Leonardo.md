um hmm and behind it all using the mac input signals for the jog x and y using the keyboard plug-in telling it what we want configured in the keyboard just there the arduino it's got its code there that's all that's running to make all

that work and you can use with the arduino obviously you've got 26 inputs there with the keys then put put the control on top that multiplies it by another 26 and the shift another 26 you haven't got enough inputs in mach 4

to contest with the keyboard but the arduino you can also take the outputs for it as well so the outputs can go down there and go in the arduino and tell the arduino to do something else there's just so much you can do with it with

just that tiny little arduino leonardo well that's it for this video i weren't supposed to be doing this for quite a few weeks yet i've got things to do on my machine my lovely parcel from slow boat china has finally

turned up so i should have been doing that today really but i hope it's given you some information and an insight to how valuable that keyboard plug-in is all right i'll see you again soon nah i can't go yet

ever wondered what's inside one of these let's have a look oh that looks familiar it's the pcb out of a usb keyboard hmm that's handy yep and it's just connected to some keys that you configure in mac anyway

i'm off to go and play with this lovely little beauty
