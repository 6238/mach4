[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] so what is software surface speed well it's not - it will not replace AG 96 but it's got me up and running using constant surface speed it's a

straightforward little lower script running in a lower panel you can use it in metric actually says surface me as a minute it should be MP m but we can change that in the script that's not a problem so you can do it in in either

set your surface surface feet a minute you can actually put in a minimum rpm and a maximum rpm if I move my x-axis you'll see nothing has changed because one thing we have to do is turn it on so if you just turn it on before you

press cycle start or do anything it will well it will change the RPM recording so what it needs if you decide you want to change anything in here it will not change it will still be running 900 within the software you have to turn it

off and turn it back on then it will you know be writing it will reset itself so let's have a look how do we install this on to our machine so first off let's go into our screen editor choose where every what screen you're

gonna put it on and we'll add a lure panel and I'll just stick that down here well won't it we go into our properties and the script section which will bring up one of these boxes and you should attach to this post that you should find

the script which I've included that's all you need to do is copy it go back into your lower panel and paste it that's it you'd come out of everything and save it now I've got two on my screen you'll find a say you'll have to resize the

actual lower panel until you get it to the right size to hold the scripts but that that's it that's all all you need to do so if you want to change the defaults we i've stuck a little default on the side of each one that you need to

change make sure the radio button is correct and is all that do is change the defaults for these two here it says they're simple 0 & 1 changes 0 to 1 and you know that that should default the default startup which i've put in is

mine starts up on those 3 figures there but you can change them to what you like as just a default stop and that's it that's just a simple straightforward script and that will get you running I have tested all these calculations and

all the calculators that I found online for doing a formula to give me the RPM for surface feet-per-minute and whatever the calculations on air come back exactly the same so you shouldn't have any problems with it if we do leave me a

comment below if you like it leave me another comment so let house see you next time was I babbling a bit
