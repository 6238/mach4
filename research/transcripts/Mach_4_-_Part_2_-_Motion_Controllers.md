[Music] [Music] hi welcome to part two in this video we're going to concentrate on motion controllers it's not a review of what is the best motion controller what is the worst motion controller anything like that this this

video is all to do with when you're starting out with CNC Mac 4 and you require a motion controller just some of the consider s you'll need to think about before you purchase one so what type of machine are you

going to build there's plenty of ideas it could be a mill you're going to be using it could be a leave could be a plasma cutter laser cutter or laser engraver pipe benders engravers basically with Mac 4 you can build whatever you you can

imagine but will the motion controller be sufficient to run what you have imagined well you might think to yourself that a motion controller is a motion controller so it does motion well Mac 4 is a G-Code interpreter trajectory

planner whatever way you want to put it it tells the motion controller plug-in what it wants it to do now for an example if you was using or wanting to build a laser engraver then you're going to be using the m62 command and

the m63 command now that does not mean just because it's included within Mac 4 that it will work on your motion controller you need to do some research to make sure the m62 and m63 is included with it the same as some of the g-codes

that are in Mac 4 if we scroll up a bit some of the G codes that are in Mac 4 like your rigid tapping um anything like that as an example that does not mean that is included in the motion controller look at the manufacturer of

the motion controller and check to make sure those commands are there and they are working next to consider is the io capabilities of the motion controller is it sufficient for the inputs that you're going to need to send

to Mac 4 has it got sufficient output signals for what you want to send from Mac 4 these can be simple things input signals like limit switches home switches probing absolutely anything that you need to send a signal to Mac 4

equally with the output signals this can be from enabling a dust vac to turning on a spindle missed control there's just so many things whatever can turn on and off basically you need to consider have you got enough

on that board but don't get me wrong it's not it's not the end of the world if it if if it hasn't there are IO Boards out there that are purely IO boards and not motion controllers but I would con consider this before you get

it and then find out you just haven't got enough inputs and outputs on that one controller board you have brought the next thing to take into consideration is Mac 4 is constantly moving constantly getting better more

things being added now one thing I would look at is how often do the manufacturers update their plugin I'm going use the pmdx as an example and as you can see they're constantly updating their plug-in for

their smart bob every time there's a fault it gets updated if a new feature comes out in Mac 4 it gets updated there's nothing worse than having a motion controller and oh eight months down the line there's been so much new stuff put into

Mac 4 but yet the manufacturer of your motion controller has not yet updated the plug-in to allow you to use them new features or even use some of the features that have been there from the beginning lastly I really got to say

something about support now when you go out and buy a product me myself I actually check what sort of support I will have if I purchase that product now most of the bigger contenders like your hon pmdx um the ESS from warp 9 pokes etc

for motion controllers now they've all got their own forums they're all very well maintained and run and you get all the backup that you need from there but we've also got Mac 4 Forum which is actually hidden in the Mac fre forum and

so I've got to make a mention I'm not associated with pmdx but the sort of the support you get from these guys um Bob from PDX and Steve now apart from giving support on their own site will actually come on to Mac 4 site and

give a little bit of a backup for their product now I haven't seen that from any other motion controller um for Mac 4 do that yet on the Mac 4 site so come on guys get your act together and give us users a little

bit more of a backup from you well that's about it ended with a bit of a winge but I hope that helps you decide when building a machine of what motion controller that you should be looking at so you don't just jump in and find out

you got something that's no good well I'll see you in the next video [Music]
